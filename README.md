## Objective
A live dashboard built with React.js that listens to a WebSocket server for incoming alerts in real time and displays them without needing a page refresh.

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack
- React.js
- WebSockets
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## ðŸ“¡ Expected Message Format
```json
{
  "type": "alert",
  "hostname": "PC-01",
  "message": "Unauthorized process detected"
}
```
Features
1. Connects to a WebSocket server.

2. Displays incoming alerts in a table format.

3. New alerts appear at the top of the list in real time.

## USAGE
To get started with the Real-Time Alert Dashboard, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rukundo-Bahati/Real-Time-Alert-Dashboard.git
cd Real-Time-Alert-Dashboard
npm install
npm start
```

Once the app is running, it will automatically connect to the configured WebSocket server and start displaying alerts as they arrive.

> **Note:** Ensure your WebSocket server sends alert messages in the expected JSON format shown above.

## How It Works
The Real-Time Alert Dashboard listens to a WebSocket server for incoming alert messages. When an alert is received, it is displayed immediately at the top of the alert list without requiring a page refresh. This allows users to monitor alerts in real time efficiently.

The app is built with React.js and uses WebSocket APIs to maintain a live connection with the server. Alerts include information such as the hostname and message, which are displayed in a user-friendly table.

## Release Notes
### Version 1.0.0
- Initial release of the Real-Time Alert Dashboard.
- Real-time alert display using WebSocket connection.
- Alerts are shown in a sortable and searchable table.
- Supports alert messages with hostname and message details.
- Responsive UI built with React.js for seamless user experience.

## File Structure and Component Roles


- **src/main.tsx**: Entry point of the React app. Renders the main `App` component into the root DOM element.
- **src/App.tsx**: Main app component that sets up global providers including React Query, theme, tooltips, and routing. Defines routes for the main `Index` page and a catch-all `NotFound` page.
- **src/pages/Index.tsx**: The main dashboard page. Manages alert state, handles WebSocket connections via `useWebSocket` hook, and renders the main UI components including `Header`, `AlertStats`, `AlertList`, and `AlertDetailsDialog`.
- **src/components/Header.tsx**: Displays the app title, theme toggle switch, connection status indicator, and a button to generate demo alerts.
- **src/components/AlertStats.tsx**: Shows alert statistics such as total alerts, critical alerts, warnings, and active hosts in a grid of cards.
- **src/components/AlertList.tsx**: Displays the live alert feed in a scrollable list. Each alert shows severity, hostname, message, and timestamp. Alerts are clickable to view details.
- **src/components/AlertDetailsDialog.tsx**: Modal dialog that shows detailed information about a selected alert including severity, source host, timestamp, message, and technical details.
- **src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx**: Wraps the app with theme context provider supporting dark mode and system preferences.
- **src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts**: Custom hook managing the WebSocket connection to receive real-time alerts. Handles connection status, reconnection attempts, and parsing incoming alert messages.
- **src/utils/alertUtils.ts**: Utility functions for alert severity determination and related helpers.
- **src/utils/timestamp.ts**: Utility functions for formatting timestamps.
- **src/types/Alert.ts**: TypeScript type definitions for alert objects.

This structure provides a modular and maintainable codebase for the real-time alert dashboard application.

## Filter Feature
The dashboard includes a powerful filter feature that allows users to filter alerts by severity, hostname, message content, or date. Use the filter dropdown to select the filter type, then enter or select the corresponding filter value. The alert list updates in real time to show only matching alerts, helping you quickly find relevant information.

## Backend Connectivity
The frontend connects to a backend WebSocket server that streams real-time alerts. To start the backend server, navigate to the `backend` folder and run:

```bash
node server.cjs
```

Ensure the backend server is running before starting the frontend to receive live alerts.

## Demo Alerts and useEffect in Index.tsx
For development or testing purposes, the app can generate demo alerts automatically. This is controlled by a `useEffect` hook in `src/pages/Index.tsx`. By default, this demo alert generation is disabled to prioritize live backend alerts.

To enable demo alerts, uncomment the relevant `useEffect` code in `Index.tsx`. This allows the app to generate random alerts periodically, useful when the backend server is not available.
